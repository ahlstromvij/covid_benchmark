# Worst of the Bunch? Benchmarking Government Performance During COVID-19

Benchmarking theories suggest information about other countries’ economic performances provides references that voters use to reward good performance and punish underperformance as a form of democratic accountability. But does this hold also for non-economic information communicated visually? Using a pre-registered experiment, we showed UK respondents an image displaying the UK’s exceptionally high cumulative COVID-19 deaths either in isolation or alongside European countries with fewer deaths. In line with benchmarking, seeing the UK as “worst of the bunch” caused respondents to evaluate the government more negatively compared to seeing UK-only data. This was particularly the case among respondents holding high levels of trust in government, suggesting trust raised expectations that were frustrated by benchmarks revealing under-performance. By contrast, against our expectations, partisanship did not moderate evaluations. Our results theoretically extends benchmarking beyond economic settings to show how comparative information—communicated in visual forms—changes evaluations.
